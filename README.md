This project focuses on segmenting customers of an online retail business using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to divide the customer base into distinct segments based on their behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. These segments can then be used for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and improved customer engagement.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files and directories:

* `data`: This directory holds the dataset used for customer segmentation. Ensure that the dataset is stored in the correct location before running the code.
* `notebook`: This directory contains Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, customer segmentation model development, and evaluation.
* `README.md`: This file provides a brief overview of the project and its contents.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
* Place the customer dataset in the correct location.
* Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, develop customer segmentation models, and evaluate their performance.
* Run the Python scripts in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the segmentation models, and visualize the results.

## Usage
To use the trained customer segmentation models for the online retail business, follow these steps:

* Load the trained segmentation models using the provided script or notebook.
* Provide new customer data or use historical data for segmentation.
* Apply necessary data transformations and feature engineering.
* Use the segmentation models to categorize customers into different segments.
* Develop targeted marketing strategies, product recommendations, and personalized promotions for each customer segment.
